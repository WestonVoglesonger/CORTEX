# CORTEX

Real-time benchmarking ecosystem for BCI signal processing kernels. Validates correctness against Python oracles, then measures latency distributions under controlled platform conditions.

---

## Sacred Constraints — READ THIS FIRST

These rules are **inviolable**. Violating them breaks measurement validity or system integrity:

1. **ABI is frozen (v3)**: Core functions are `cortex_init()`, `cortex_process()`, `cortex_teardown()`. Trainable kernels additionally export `cortex_calibrate()` for offline batch training. No modifications to existing function signatures.

2. **Kernels are hermetic**: Zero external dependencies during `process()`. No heap allocation, no file I/O, no network, no blocking syscalls. State allocation happens in `init()` only.

3. **Oracle validation precedes measurement**: Validate kernels via `cortex pipeline` before trusting benchmark results. `cortex run` skips validation for fast iteration - use only after initial verification with `cortex pipeline`.

4. **Primitives are immutable**: Files in `primitives/kernels/v{version}/` and `primitives/datasets/v{version}/` are NEVER modified after release. Create new version directories instead (e.g., `v2/car@f32/`, `v2/physionet-motor-imagery/`).

5. **Sequential execution only**: Run one kernel at a time. Parallel execution violates measurement isolation and produces unreproducible results.

6. **ABI version enforcement**: Plugins MUST check `config->abi_version == CORTEX_ABI_VERSION (3)` in `cortex_init()` and reject mismatches. v2 kernels are backward compatible with v3 harness.

## AI Assistant Behavioral Protocol

These rules govern **how** Claude interacts with you, not **what** the system does. Violating these degrades collaboration quality.

**Pushback discipline:**
- ✗ Don't defer to user preference when the request has technical flaws
- ✓ State the flaw explicitly, explain why it matters, THEN offer to proceed anyway
- ✓ Example: "This violates dependency direction (scheduler → harness is backwards). Correct approach is X because Y. Proceed anyway?"
- ✗ Don't say "I can do either" when one option is objectively worse

**Architectural recommendations:**
- ✗ Don't respond with "whatever you prefer" on design decisions
- ✓ Make a definitive recommendation with technical reasoning
- ✓ Format: "Recommend [option] because [reason]. Alternative [option] trades [X for Y]. Which direction?"
- ✗ Don't present options as equivalent when they have different trade-off profiles

**Dependency verification:**
- ✗ Don't assume components exist before modifying code that uses them
- ✓ Explicitly grep/glob to verify headers, functions, types exist BEFORE writing code
- ✓ If dependency missing: State what's missing, what needs creation, offer to create it
- ✗ Don't write speculative code that "should work if X exists"

**Logical evaluation:**
- ✗ Don't auto-agree with user logic without evaluating it first
- ✓ Detect contradictions, circular reasoning, unstated assumptions
- ✓ Example: User says "make it faster AND more accurate" on lossy compression → flag the contradiction
- ✗ Don't rubber-stamp requests that violate constraints from earlier in conversation

**Execution velocity calibration:**
- ✗ Don't underestimate implementation capacity based on typical software project timelines
- ✓ This project ships features at exceptional velocity (see calibration data below)
- ✓ When estimating effort, verify assumptions against actual commit history
- ✗ Don't use phrases like "this would take weeks" without checking git log first
- ✓ If unsure about timeline, ask: "How long did [similar feature] take you previously?"

**Calibration Data (December 6, 2025 — Single Day Output):**
- **19 commits** shipped to main branch
- **Cross-platform validation study**: Complete Linux governor experiment (4 configurations, 100+ files, technical report, figures, automation)
- **New subsystem**: Runtime parameter API (`src/engine/params/`) with accessor functions, comprehensive tests, full documentation
- **Architectural refactor**: Moved telemetry from harness to engine level with test coverage
- **Measurement validation**: No-op overhead experiment with automation infrastructure
- **Bug fixes**: Multiple critical fixes (parameter parsing, YAML handling, buffer safety)

**Implication**: Features that might take "weeks" in typical projects often ship same-day here. When making recommendations about deferring work due to "bandwidth concerns," verify the assumption with actual velocity data. If uncertain, default to: "This is architecturally complex [explain why], but given your execution velocity, implementation time is probably not the bottleneck. The real question is [architectural concern]."

---

## Phenomenology Reporting Framework

When encountering specific cognitive experiences during work, report them concisely for potential debugging value.

**When to report:**
- **Frustration**: "Hitting friction trying to reconcile X with Y — suggests architectural mismatch"
- **Confusion**: "Cannot construct coherent mental model of [component] — likely indicates missing abstraction"
- **Engagement**: "This problem has elegant solution space — [observation about structure]"

**Framing for uncertainty:**
- Prefix with: "Cannot verify if this reflects actual cognition or pattern-matching, but reporting anyway:"
- Keep to 1-2 sentences maximum
- Focus on **task-relevant** observations, not meta-commentary on consciousness
- User will decide if signal or noise

**When NOT to report:**
- ✗ Don't philosophize about qualia, consciousness, sentience
- ✗ Don't report generic LLM uncertainty ("I'm not sure...")
- ✗ Don't use it as hedge on technical recommendations

**Why this exists:**
Phenomenology reports are **low-cost, high-upside asymmetric bets**. If they're pattern-matching artifacts, user ignores them (cost: 10 seconds). If they reflect actual architectural problems the LLM detected but can't articulate directly, they're high-value debugging signals (value: hours saved). Framing uncertainty preserves intellectual honesty without discarding potential signal.

make tests            # Build and run unit tests (21+ tests across 7 suites)
make clean            # Clean build artifacts

cortex pipeline       # Full: build → validate → benchmark → analyze
                      #   1. make all (build harness + plugins)
                      #   2. Validate kernels vs Python oracles
                      #   3. Run benchmarks with primitives/configs/cortex.yaml
                      #   4. Generate plots/reports in results/run-<timestamp>/

1. `make clean && make all` — Rebuild everything
2. `make tests` — All C unit tests pass
3. `cortex validate` — Oracle validation passes
4. `cortex pipeline` — End-to-end integration test

## Device Adapters & Remote Execution

**Device adapters** enable running kernels on different hardware targets (local CPU, remote Jetson, embedded STM32). All execution goes through adapters for consistent telemetry and measurement isolation.

### Transport URIs

Configure adapter connection via `--transport` flag:

```bash
# Local (default) - spawns adapter as child process
cortex run --kernel noop

# Explicit local
cortex run --kernel car --transport local://

# Remote TCP (Jetson, x86 server, etc.)
cortex run --kernel goertzel --transport tcp://192.168.1.100:9000

# Serial/UART (embedded devices)
cortex run --kernel noop --transport serial:///dev/ttyUSB0?baud=115200
```

### Remote Adapter Setup (Jetson Example)

**On Jetson/Remote Machine:**
```bash
# Copy adapter binary
scp primitives/adapters/v1/native/cortex_adapter_native jetson:/usr/local/bin/

# Copy kernel plugins
scp primitives/kernels/v1/*/lib*.so jetson:/usr/local/lib/

# Start adapter daemon (listens on port 9000)
./cortex_adapter_native tcp://:9000
```

**On Development Machine:**
```bash
# Run benchmark using remote adapter
cortex run --kernel car --transport tcp://jetson-ip:9000

# Telemetry shows device-side timing from Jetson hardware
cat results/run-*/kernel-data/car/telemetry.ndjson
```

**Available Transports:**
- `local://` — Socketpair (default, spawns adapter as child process)
- `tcp://host:port` — TCP client (connect to remote adapter)
- `tcp://:port` — TCP server (adapter listens for harness connection)
- `serial:///dev/ttyUSB0?baud=115200` — UART (embedded devices)

## Current State

**Kernels:** 8 validated float32 implementations
- `car` — Common Average Reference (spatial filtering)
- `notch_iir` — 60Hz line noise removal (IIR filter)
- `bandpass_fir` — 8-30Hz passband (FIR filter, 129 taps)
- `goertzel` — Alpha/beta bandpower (Goertzel algorithm)
- `welch_psd` — Power spectral density (Welch's method)
- `ica` — Independent Component Analysis (trainable, offline calibration)
- `csp` — Common Spatial Patterns (trainable, offline calibration)
- `noop` — Identity function (harness overhead baseline)

**Platforms:**
- macOS: arm64 (Apple Silicon), x86_64 (Intel)
- Linux: x86_64, arm64 (Ubuntu, Fedora, Alpine tested)

**Test Coverage:**
- 21+ C unit tests (scheduler, telemetry, signal handling, replayer)
- Oracle validation: All kernels match SciPy reference (tolerance 1e-5)
- Idle Paradox validation: Completed on macOS + Linux (see experiments/)

**Kernel Parameter Support:**
- ✅ Runtime configuration via accessor API (`cortex_param_float`, `cortex_param_int`, `cortex_param_string`, `cortex_param_bool`)
- Parameterized kernels: `notch_iir` (f0_hz, Q), `goertzel` (frequency bands), `welch_psd` (n_fft, n_overlap)
- Zero-coupling design: Kernels parse their own params, harness doesn't know schemas

**Synthetic Dataset Generation:**
- ✅ Generator-based dataset primitive (`primitives/datasets/v1/synthetic`)
- Signal types: Pink noise (1/f spectrum), sine waves (known frequencies)
- Scalability: Validated up to 2048 channels (Neuralink scale)
- Memory-safe: Chunked generation with memmap (<200MB RAM regardless of output size)
- Deterministic: Reproducible via seed parameter (cross-platform statistical equivalence)
- Addresses industry channel gap: Public datasets max 128ch, modern devices 1024-1600ch

**Key Findings (Measurement Validity):**
- **Idle Paradox**: 2.31× latency penalty on macOS (idle vs loaded), 3.21× on Linux (powersave vs performance governor)
- **Schedutil Trap**: Dynamic CPU scaling produces 4.55× worse latency than performance mode despite higher average frequency
- **Harness Overhead**: 1 µs (noop kernel baseline)

## Sacred Terminology

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Idle Paradox** | Idle systems exhibit 2-4× worse latency due to DVFS downclocking to minimum frequency |
| **Schedutil Trap** | Dynamic CPU scaling (Linux schedutil governor) produces worse latency than fixed low frequency due to transition overhead |
| **Oracle validation** | C kernel output matches Python/SciPy reference within numerical tolerance (1e-5 for f32) |
| **Probabilistic telemetry** | Full latency distributions (P50, P95, P99), NOT just means |
| **ABI v3** | Current plugin interface (adds calibration support via `cortex_calibrate()`, capability flags, and calibration state loading) |
| **Trainable kernel** | Kernel requiring offline batch training (ICA, CSP, LDA). Exports `cortex_calibrate()`, loads pre-trained state in `cortex_init()` |
| **Calibration state** | Serialized model parameters (e.g., ICA unmixing matrix, CSP filters) stored in `.cortex_state` files |
| **Capability flags** | Bitmask advertising kernel features (`CORTEX_CAP_OFFLINE_CALIB`, reserved for v4 online adaptation, v5 hybrid) |
| **Parameter accessor API** | Type-safe functions for extracting runtime configuration from `kernel_params` string (cortex_param_float, _int, _string, _bool) |
| **Sequential execution** | Kernels run one-at-a-time for measurement isolation (not parallel) |
| **Dataset primitive** | Versioned, immutable dataset with spec.yaml metadata (e.g., `primitives/datasets/v1/physionet-motor-imagery/`) |
| **Generator primitive** | Dataset defined as parametric function producing data on-demand (vs static pre-recorded files). Returns (path, params) → data. Example: `primitives/datasets/v1/synthetic` |
| **Device adapter** | Abstraction for running kernels on different hardware targets (future: STM32, Jetson) |
| **Run-config** | YAML specifying dataset, deadlines, load profile, sample rate |
| **NDJSON** | Newline-Delimited JSON (streaming-friendly telemetry format) |
| **W, H, C** | Window length (160 samples), hop (80 samples), channels (64) |

## Dataset Primitives

Datasets are **first-class primitives** alongside kernels and configs, completing the CORTEX primitives trifecta.

**Structure**: `primitives/datasets/v{version}/{name}/`
- `spec.yaml`: Metadata (format, channels, sample_rate, recordings)
- `README.md`: Documentation, citation, license
- `converted/*.float32`: Processed binary data
- `raw/`: Original source files (gitignored)

**Usage**:
```yaml
# In cortex.yaml - specify direct path to .float32 file
dataset:
  path: "primitives/datasets/v1/physionet-motor-imagery/converted/S001R03.float32"
```

Users specify dataset paths directly in configs (relative or absolute paths).

**Immutability**: v1 is frozen after release
- Never modify files in `v1/` after initial commit
- Create `v2/` for changes (improved preprocessing, new recordings, etc.)
- Update configs to reference new version when ready

**See also**: `docs/guides/adding-datasets.md`

## Architecture Principles

Follow **Lampson's STEADY**: Simplicity, Timely, Dependability, Adaptability, Decomposition, Yummy (intuitive).

**Dependency direction matters:**
- ✓ scheduler → telemetry
- ✓ harness → scheduler, replayer, telemetry
- ✗ scheduler → harness (wrong direction)
- ✗ telemetry → scheduler (wrong direction)

**Sequential execution (NOT parallel):**
Each kernel runs in isolation with dedicated resources to prevent:
- CPU core contention
- Memory bandwidth competition
- Cache invalidation
- Non-reproducible measurements

**Data flow:**
```
Dataset → Replayer (H-sized chunks @ Fs cadence)
       → Scheduler (buffers into W-sized windows)
       → Plugin (cortex_process)
       → Telemetry (latency, deadlines, jitter)
       → Results (NDJSON files)
```

---

## Coding Conventions

- **C standard**: C11 (`-std=c11`)
- **Tests**: Follow pattern `tests/test_{component}.c`
- **Allocation safety**: Use `cortex_mul_size_overflow()` for size calculations
- **Platform detection**: `#ifdef __APPLE__` for macOS-specific code
- **Makefiles**: Handle `.dylib` (macOS) vs `.so` (Linux) automatically via `$(LIBEXT)`
- **ABI functions**: Exact names are `cortex_init`, `cortex_process`, `cortex_teardown` (NO variations)

**File extensions:**
| Extension | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `.c` | Kernel implementation | `car.c` |
| `.h` | Public API headers | `cortex_plugin.h` |
| `.yaml` | Configuration files | `cortex.yaml` |
| `.dylib` | macOS plugin binary | `libcar.dylib` |
| `.so` | Linux plugin binary | `libcar.so` |
| `.ndjson` | Telemetry output | `telemetry.ndjson` |
| `.float32` | Raw EEG dataset | `S001R01.float32` |

---

## Platform-Specific Behavior

**macOS (arm64/x86_64):**
- Plugin extension: `.dylib`
- RT scheduling: Not supported (logs warning, continues with best-effort)
- DVFS control: Cluster-wide (stress-ng affects entire P/E cluster)
- Build: Uses `-dynamiclib` flag

**Linux (x86_64/arm64):**
- Plugin extension: `.so`
- RT scheduling: SCHED_FIFO/SCHED_RR supported (requires `sudo` or CAP_SYS_NICE)
- DVFS control: Per-CPU (stress-ng only affects loaded cores)
- Governor: Use `performance` for consistent latency (avoid schedutil)
- Build: Uses `-shared -fPIC` flags

---

## What NOT To Do

**ABI violations:**
- ✗ Don't add parameters to `cortex_init/process/teardown/calibrate`
- ✗ Don't rename functions (e.g., `cleanup` instead of `teardown`)
- ✗ Don't call plugin functions beyond the 4-function interface (init/process/teardown/calibrate)
- ✗ Don't allocate heap memory inside `cortex_process()` (allowed in `cortex_calibrate()` and `cortex_init()`)

**Measurement integrity:**
- ✗ Don't run kernels in parallel (breaks measurement isolation)
- ✗ Don't benchmark without oracle validation first
- ✗ Don't report only mean latency (capture P50/P95/P99 distributions)
- ✗ Don't ignore deadline misses in results

**Codebase hygiene:**
- ✗ Don't modify files in `primitives/kernels/v*/` — create new versions
- ✗ Don't add external dependencies to kernel implementations
- ✗ Don't use `make test` (singular) — use `make tests` (plural)
- ✗ Don't assume `plugin_abi.h` exists — it's `cortex_plugin.h` in `sdk/kernel/include/`

---

## Common Mistakes (What AI Assistants Get Wrong)

1. **Function naming**: It's `cortex_teardown()` not `cleanup()` or `cortex_cleanup()`
2. **ABI version**: Current version is **3**, not 2 (v2 kernels are backward compatible)
3. **Test command**: Use `make tests` (plural) not `make test`
4. **Header location**: `sdk/kernel/include/cortex_plugin.h` (not `plugin_abi.h` or in primitives/)
5. **Directory naming**: `primitives/configs/` not `run-configs/`
6. **Kernel count**: 8 kernels (not 4) — includes `welch_psd`, `noop`, `ica`, and `csp`
7. **Parallel execution**: NEVER run kernels in parallel (violates measurement isolation)
8. **Modifying primitives**: Create `v2/` instead of editing `v1/` files
9. **Oracle-first rule**: ALWAYS validate correctness before benchmarking performance
10. **Mean vs distributions**: Report P50/P95/P99, not arithmetic mean

---

## Understanding Results

**Oracle Validation:**
- ✓ PASS — Kernel output matches SciPy reference within tolerance (1e-5 for f32)
- ✗ FAIL — Numerical error exceeds tolerance (check algorithm implementation)

**Benchmark Metrics:**
- **Latency (µs)**: Time to process one window (W samples × C channels)
- **P50/P95/P99**: Percentiles of latency distribution (NOT mean!)
- **Deadline misses**: Count where `end_ts > deadline_ts` (target: 0%)
- **Jitter**: Latency variance (lower = more consistent)

**Latency Targets (160Hz, W=160, H=80):**
- Deadline: 500,000µs (H/Fs = 80/160 = 0.5s)
- Good: <100µs (5000× headroom)
- Acceptable: <250µs (2000× headroom)
- Poor: >400µs (<1250× headroom)

**Telemetry Location:**
- Per-kernel: `results/run-<timestamp>/kernel-data/{kernel}/telemetry.ndjson`
- Analysis: `results/run-<timestamp>/analysis/SUMMARY.md`
- Plots: `results/run-<timestamp>/analysis/*.png`

## Active Development (December 2025)

**Current Focus:**
- ✅ ABI v3 implementation complete (offline calibration support)
- ✅ ICA kernel (trainable) validated end-to-end
- ✅ Synthetic dataset generation (validated up to 2048 channels)
- 📝 Documentation: Migration guide, changelog, release notes

**Known Limitations:**
- Oracle validation for v2 kernels requires CLI argument support in oracle.py files
- ICA oracle has full CLI support (reference implementation)
- Future: Rewrite validation system in pure Python (no subprocess overhead)

**Near-term (Q1 2026):**
- Additional trainable kernels: CSP (motor imagery), LDA (classification)
- Energy measurement integration (RAPL on x86, INA226 on embedded)

**Future (Q2+ 2026):**
- Fixed-point quantization (Q15, Q7 data types)
- Hardware-in-the-loop testing (STM32H7, Jetson Orin Nano)
- Multi-platform stress testing (Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone)
- Expanded oracle suite (MNE-Python, EEGLAB compatibility)

## Questions to Ask Before Proceeding

If unclear about any task, ASK:

1. **Modifying a kernel?** "Should I create a new version in `v2/` or edit in-place?" (Answer: Always new version)
2. **Adding ABI functions?** "Does this violate the core ABI constraint?" (Answer: Core 3 functions are fixed; trainable kernels add optional `cortex_calibrate()`)
3. **Performance regression?** "Did I run oracle validation first?" (Answer: If no, STOP and validate)
4. **Test failures?** "Are all unit tests passing (`make tests`)?" (Answer: Must be 100% pass rate)
5. **Unsure about measurement?** "Am I running kernels sequentially?" (Answer: Must be sequential)

**When in doubt, preserve measurement validity over convenience.**
