Following the docs will raise an “unknown flag” error and prevent benchmarking a trained kernel. Please update the example (or add a CLI alias) so the documented workflow actually runs.\n\nUseful?

For those kernels compiled with `CORTEX_ABI_VERSION == 3`, this code will pass `abi_version = 2`, causing `cortex_init()` to reject the config and preventing the kernel from running. Consider a different v3/v2 detection strategy (e.g., a dedicated symbol or attempting v3 first and falling back on failure) so stateless v3 kernels can initialize correctly.\n\nUseful?

That can let regressions slip through CI or local workflows because users think all kernels were validated. Consider returning a non‑zero exit code (or implementing the all‑kernels loop) so missing coverage is not treated as a pass.\n    \n\n<details> <summary>ℹ️ About Codex in GitHub</summary>\n<br/>\n\n[Your team has set up Codex to review pull requests in this repo](http://chatgpt.com/codex/settings/general).
