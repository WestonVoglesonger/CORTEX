That means `cortex run --all --state <file>` silently drops the state and trainable kernels receive `NULL`, which can make them fail init or run uncalibrated. If `--state` is meant to work with auto-detect, you either need to synthesize a plugins list (or reject `--state` with `--all`) instead of ignoring it.\n\nUseful?

Following the printed instructions will fail with an unknown flag, so the guidance should match the actual CLI option.\n\nUseful?
