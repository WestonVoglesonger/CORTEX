As a result, `cortex run --all --state <file>` silently drops the state path, so trainable kernels receive `NULL` and either fail init or run uncalibrated. This contradicts the CLI’s documented behavior (“applied to all trainable kernels”) and makes `--state` ineffective in the common auto-detect path.\n\nUseful?
